A closure is the ability to access variables that are out of scope of the 
current function. Child functions having access to all parent function 
variables and scope.

Ex:

Closure summary - When you have a function defined inside of another function, 
the inner function has access to the variables and scope of the outer function. 
Even if the outer function finishes executing and those variables are no longer 
accessible outside that function.

A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them. 
In some languages, that's not possible, but in Javascript, all functions are 
naturally closures with only one exception(the new function syntax). That is, 
they automatically remember where they were created using a hidden [[Environment]] 
property and then their code can access outer variables.

In an interview, when you're asked what a closure is, a valid answer would be:
